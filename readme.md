### AWS Step Function

## AWS Step Functions Overview

- **Workflow Sequencing**: Step Functions enable the creation of workflows that follow a predefined sequence of steps or tasks.

- **Orchestration Tool**: They serve as an orchestration tool, allowing for the coordination and automation of various AWS services and resources.

- **Native Integration**: Step Functions offer seamless integration with AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS, providing built-in support.

#### Step function learning Path.

1. **Understand Step Functions Concepts**:

   - Familiarize yourself with the core concepts of AWS Step Functions, including state machines, states, tasks, input/output processing, and error handling.
   - Learn about the different types of states available in Step Functions, such as Task state, Choice state, Parallel state, etc.

2. **Learn Amazon States Language (ASL)**:

   - ASL is the JSON-based language used to define state machine workflows in AWS Step Functions. Learn the syntax and structure of ASL.
   - Understand how to define different types of states using ASL, including tasks, choices, parallels, and more.

3. **Hands-On Tutorials**:

   - Follow hands-on tutorials and examples provided in the AWS Step Functions documentation to create and execute simple state machines.
   - Experiment with different types of tasks and states to understand their behavior and capabilities.

4. **Integrate with Serverless Framework**:

   - Understand how to define Step Functions workflows in your Serverless Framework project using the `stepFunctions` section in your `serverless.yml` file.
   - Learn how to define state machines, states, and tasks using the Serverless Framework's YAML syntax.

5. **Advanced Features**:

   - Explore advanced features of AWS Step Functions such as input/output processing, error handling, retries, timeouts, and logging.
   - Learn how to implement complex workflows using Choice states, Parallel states, and other advanced features of Step Functions.

6. **Best Practices**:

   - Familiarize yourself with best practices for designing, implementing, and managing Step Functions workflows.
   - Learn about performance optimization, cost management, and security best practices for Step Functions.

7. **Testing and Debugging**:

   - Learn how to test and debug Step Functions workflows locally using the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code or other local development tools.
   - Understand how to monitor and troubleshoot Step Functions executions using CloudWatch Logs and other monitoring tools.

8. **Real-World Projects**:
   - Work on real-world projects or use cases that require workflow automation using Step Functions.
   - Integrate Step Functions workflows into your Serverless Framework projects to automate complex business processes or workflows.

#### Use case of aws step function

1. Order processing in E-Commerce.
2. Automated data pipelines.

#### Step functions State machines

Logical unit that defines the workflow or a business process you want to orchestrate, It represents a sequence of steps or states, each of which performs a specific task or action

#### Understand the state machines and workflow to setup step functions

### Serverless Framework integrations

sls create -t aws-nodejs

Example:

1. Check candidate Availability Choice
2. If available -> schedule Interview Handler Task
3. Else Add Candidate Handler Task
